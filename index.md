If you are a faculty member and would like to have a library instructor lead one of these workshops a class or a research group, please email us at 
 <a href="mailto:dscommons@uvic.ca?Subject=GenAI Workshop Request">dscommons@uvic.ca</a> so that we can discuss your specific needs and learning objectives for your group.

## Introductory Workshops
1. **[GenAI: Introduction & Prompt Design](https://lib.uvic.ca/gen-ai){:target="_blank"}** (_Introduction_)
   - Workshop participants will explore the use of GenAI to assist with Student Research for idea generation and consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism, privacy, and research integrity.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage and output evaluation for accuracy and biases. The workshop will also encourage informed, responsible GenAI use.
2. **AI: Tools for Literature Reviews** (_Introduction_) - COMING SOON
   - Workshop participants will explore the use of GenAI to assist with literature reviews, and review the ethical considerations such as plagiarism, privacy, and research integrity.
