# Generative AI Workshop Pathway
Generative AI (GenAI) tools are truly double-edged swords. They can be helpful to subject-area experts, making their work more efficient. However, for those who lack subject expertise, these tools can lead to embarrassment or worse if the facts & analysis provided by GenAI tools are not checked for accuracy.
