This Generative AI workshop series is designed to meet the diverse needs of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff by offering tailored sessions that cover foundational to advanced topics in Generative AI. To help you find the workshops best suited to your current skill level, the workshops have been categorized as either:
   - **[Introductory](#introductory-workshops)**
   - **[Intermediate](#intermediate-workshops)** 
   - **[Advanced](#advanced-workshops)**

The workshop materials are designed to be used in a classroom setting or by individuals on their own. If you'd like to take one of these instructor-led workshops or work through them on your own, please check out at our list of <a href="https://lib.uvic.ca/curric">upcoming workshops & lesson plans</a>{:target="_blank"}.

If you are a faculty member and would like to have a library instructor lead one of these workshops a class or a research group, please email us at 
 <a href="mailto:dscommons@uvic.ca?Subject=GenAI Workshop Request">dscommons@uvic.ca</a> so that we can discuss your specific needs and learning objectives for your group.

## Introductory Workshops
1. **[GenAI: Introduction & Prompt Design](https://lib.uvic.ca/gen-ai){:target="_blank"}** (_Introduction_)
   - Workshop participants will explore the use of GenAI to assist with Student Research for idea generation & consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism & privacy.

## Intermediate Workshops
1. **[GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal Tool for Research & Productivity](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-notebooklm){:target="_blank"}** (_Intermediate_)
   - Participants will explore how NoteBookLM can be a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool grounded in information you give it to use as training data.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore various ways NotebookLM can be used for research and productivity & evaluate its outputs for accuracy and biases. 
3. **GenAI: Presentation & Multi-Media Tools** (_Intermediate_) - COMING SOON
 
## Advanced Workshops
1. **AI: Tools for Literature Reviews** (_Advanced_) - COMING SOON
3. **[GenAI: Research Tools](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-research-adv){:target="_blank"}** (_Advanced_)
   - Participants will explore the use of more advanced GenAI tools & techniques including installing and using local GenAI software on a laptop.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tools using specific documents as the training data (as opposed to the whole web), analyze Excel spreadsheets, perform sentiment analysis on free-form survey questions, and assist with qualitative coding.
