# Generative AI Workshop Pathway
Generative AI (GenAI) tools are truly double-edged swords. They can be helpful to subject-area experts, making their work more efficient. However, for those who lack subject expertise, these tools can lead to embarrassment or worse if the facts & analysis provided by GenAI tools are not checked for accuracy.

This workshop series is designed to help subject area experts & non-experts & help meet the needs of students, faculty, & staff by offering foundational to advanced research & productivity skills training:
   - **[Introductory](#introductory-workshops)**
   - **[Intermediate](#intermediate-workshops)** 
   - **[Advanced](#advanced-workshops)**

The workshop materials are designed to be used by instructors with their classes or individuals.
