# Generative AI Workshop Pathway
Generative AI (GenAI) tools can be helpful for subject-area experts, making their work more efficient. However, for those who lack expertise in a specific field, these tools can lead to problems if they don't carefully verify the facts and analysis provided by GenAI tools.

This GenAI workshop series is designed to help subject area experts and non-experts alike. Our goal is to help meet the diverse needs of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff by offering training to cover foundational to advanced research & productivity topics. To help you find the workshops best suited to your current skill level, the workshops have been categorized as follows:
   - **[Introductory](#introductory-workshops)**
   - **[Intermediate](#intermediate-workshops)** 
   - **[Advanced](#advanced-workshops)**

The workshop materials are designed to be used in a classroom setting or by individuals on their own. If you'd like to take a drop-in instructor-led workshop, please check out our list of <a href="https://lib.uvic.ca/curric">upcoming workshops</a>{:target="_blank"}. The links below are to  workshop lesson plans you can work through on your own, or review before taking one of our instructor-led sessions.

## Introductory Workshops
1. **[GenAI: Introduction & Prompt Design](https://lib.uvic.ca/gen-ai){:target="_blank"}** (_Introduction_)
   - Workshop participants will explore the use of GenAI to assist with Student Research for idea generation & consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism & privacy.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tool usage & output for accuracy & biases. The workshop will encourage informed, responsible GenAI use.
2. **AI: Tools for Literature Reviews** (_Introduction_) - COMING SOON
   - Participants will learn about various AI tools that can assist with literature reviews.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore attribution methods, and library resource integration, to encourage informed, responsible AI use.

## Intermediate Workshops
1. **[GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal Tool for Research & Productivity](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-notebooklm){:target="_blank"}** (_Intermediate_)
   - Participants will explore how NoteBookLM can be a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool grounded in information you give it to use as training data.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore various ways NotebookLM can be used for research and productivity & evaluate its outputs for accuracy and biases. 
2. **GenAI: Presentation & Multi-Media Tools** (_Intermediate_) - COMING SPRING 2025
 
## Advanced Workshops
1. **AI: Tools for Literature Reviews** (_Advanced_) - COMING SPRING 2025
2. **[GenAI: Research Tools](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-research-adv){:target="_blank"}** (_Advanced_)
   - Participants will explore the use of more advanced GenAI tools & techniques including installing and using local GenAI software on a laptop.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tools using specific documents as the training data (as opposed to the whole web), analyze datasets, perform sentiment analysis on free-form survey questions, and assist with qualitative coding.
