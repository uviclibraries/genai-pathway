# Generative AI Workshop Pathway
Generative AI (GenAI) tools can be helpful for subject-area experts, making their work more efficient. However, for those who lack expertise in a specific field, these tools can lead to problems if they don't carefully verify the facts and analysis provided by GenAI tools.

This workshop series is designed to help subject area experts and non-experts, and help meet the needs of students, faculty, & staff by offering foundational to advanced research & productivity skills training:
   - **[Introductory](#introductory-workshops)**
   - **[Intermediate](#intermediate-workshops)** 
   - **[Advanced](#advanced-workshops)**

The workshop materials are designed to be used by instructors with their classes or individuals. If you'd like to take a drop-in instructor-led workshop, please check out our list of <a href="https://lib.uvic.ca/curric">upcoming workshops</a>{:target="_blank"}. Below are workshop lesson plans you can work through, or review before taking an instructor-led session.

## Intermediate Workshops
1. **[GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal Tool for Research & Productivity](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-notebooklm){:target="_blank"}** (_Intermediate_)
   - Participants will explore how NoteBookLM can be a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool grounded in information you give it to use as training data.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore various ways NotebookLM can be used for research and productivity & evaluate its outputs for accuracy and biases. 
2. **GenAI: Presentation & Multi-Media Tools** (_Intermediate_) - COMING SPRING 2025
 
## Advanced Workshops
1. **AI: Tools for Literature Reviews** (_Advanced_) - COMING SPRING 2025
2. **[GenAI: Research Tools](https://lib.uvic.ca/genai-research-adv){:target="_blank"}** (_Advanced_)
   - Participants will explore the use of more advanced GenAI tools & techniques including installing and using local GenAI software on a laptop.
   - In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore GenAI tools using specific documents as the training data (as opposed to the whole web), analyze datasets, perform sentiment analysis on free-form survey questions, and assist with qualitative coding.
